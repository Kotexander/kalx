# Kalx
Kalx is a programming language made from scratch using Rust but inspired by C.
It compiles to x86 machine code and the project does not depend on any external dependencies.
The name holds no significance because it was just made by using letters from my name.

My goal was to learn more about the x86 architecture and the Linux operating system which I feel like I succeeded in.

## Running
Run `./run.sh` script or look inside it to learn more.
